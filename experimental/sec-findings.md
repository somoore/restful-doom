# Security Audit Findings: RESTful DOOM Experimental

**Date:** March 24, 2025  
**Author:** Security Audit Team  
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security audit assessed the RESTful DOOM experimental environment, focusing on Docker containers, network configuration, access controls, and overall security posture. The audit found that while critical and high vulnerabilities have been addressed, there remain medium-level vulnerabilities that should be monitored. The containerized architecture implements many security best practices but has several areas for improvement.

## Assessment Scope

The audit covered:
- Docker images and containers
- Network configuration and isolation
- Access controls and authentication
- File system permissions
- Configuration files
- Scripts and deployment processes

## Key Findings

### 1. Vulnerability Assessment

#### 1.1 Current Vulnerability Status
| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | 0     | Resolved ✅ |
| High     | 0     | Resolved ✅ |
| Medium   | 1724  | Needs monitoring ⚠️ |
| Low      | 390   | Acceptable risk ℹ️ |

#### 1.2 Details by Container
| Container | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------|--------|-----|-------|
| docker-doom-game | 0 | 0 | 850 | 170 | Ubuntu 22.04 base image |
| docker-novnc | 0 | 0 | 847 | 152 | Ubuntu 22.04 base image |
| docker-vnc-server | 0 | 0 | 16 | 34 | Ubuntu 22.04 base image |
| docker-web-ui | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Alpine-slim base image |
| docker-x11-server | 0 | 0 | 11 | 34 | Ubuntu 22.04 base image |

### 2. Container Security

#### 2.1 Strengths
- ✅ Base images updated to Ubuntu 22.04 and Alpine-slim
- ✅ Package updates and upgrades integrated into Dockerfiles
- ✅ Resource limits implemented for all containers
- ✅ Most containers run with reduced capabilities (NET_RAW dropped)
- ✅ `no-new-privileges:true` implemented for most containers

#### 2.2 Concerns
- ⚠️ `privileged: true` required for X11 server exposes attack surface
- ⚠️ Containers run as root by default
- ⚠️ `ipc: host` used for DOOM game container
- ⚠️ NET_ADMIN capability required for web-ui container

#### 2.3 Recommendations
- Investigate alternatives to privileged mode for X11 container
- Implement non-root users where possible
- Consider using multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface

### 3. Network Security

#### 3.1 Strengths
- ✅ Dual-network architecture with internal network isolation
- ✅ All services bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1)
- ✅ Internet blocking implemented using iptables
- ✅ Rate limiting applied to API endpoints

#### 3.2 Concerns
- ⚠️ Permissive CORS policy (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
- ⚠️ No authentication for API access
- ⚠️ No SSL/TLS implementation for API communications

#### 3.3 Recommendations
- Add documentation warning about CORS security implications
- Consider implementing basic authentication for API access even in development
- Document limitations of localhost-only binding security model

### 4. Access Controls

#### 4.1 Strengths
- ✅ VNC server protected with password
- ✅ Limited port exposure (localhost only)
- ✅ Network segmentation between containers

#### 4.2 Concerns
- ⚠️ Hard-coded VNC password ("password")
- ⚠️ No authentication for API
- ⚠️ No separate user roles or permissions

#### 4.3 Recommendations
- Make VNC password configurable via environment variables
- Consider implementing API tokens even for development

### 5. File System Security

#### 5.1 Strengths
- ✅ WAD files mounted as read-only
- ✅ Separate volumes for shared data
- ✅ Limited filesystem exposure between containers

#### 5.2 Concerns
- ⚠️ Shared memory mounts required for X11 and game communication
- ⚠️ No filesystem access restrictions within containers

#### 5.3 Recommendations
- Document risks associated with shared memory access
- Consider implementing read-only filesystem where possible

### 6. Configuration Management

#### 6.1 Strengths
- ✅ Version pinning implemented for container images
- ✅ Clear documentation of configuration options
- ✅ Environment variable usage for customization

#### 6.2 Concerns
- ⚠️ Some configuration files contain hardcoded values
- ⚠️ Limited validation of configuration inputs

#### 6.3 Recommendations
- Implement validation for all configuration inputs
- Move hardcoded values to environment variables

### 7. Security Monitoring and Response

#### 7.1 Strengths
- ✅ Security scanning script integrated
- ✅ Automatic cleanup routines

#### 7.2 Concerns
- ⚠️ No continuous monitoring implementation
- ⚠️ No automated security updates

#### 7.3 Recommendations
- Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipeline
- Implement automated update checks
- Add security headers to HTTP responses

## Medium Vulnerabilities Analysis

The medium vulnerabilities (1724 total) are primarily concentrated in the Ubuntu 22.04 base images for the DOOM game and noVNC containers. These vulnerabilities are:

1. Primarily in standard Ubuntu packages
2. Common in development environments
3. Limited in impact due to:
   - Network isolation
   - Localhost-only binding
   - Lack of external exposure

For a development environment, these represent an acceptable level of risk, but should be periodically reviewed and updated.

## Risk Analysis

| Risk Area | Risk Level | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Host System Compromise | Low | Containers use security options and isolation |
| Data Exposure | Low | No sensitive data processed by the application |
| Network Intrusion | Low | Network isolation and localhost-only binding |
| Denial of Service | Medium | Resource limits help but not comprehensive |
| Container Escape | Medium | Privileged container could be exploited |

## Conclusion

The RESTful DOOM experimental environment demonstrates solid security practices for a development environment, with effective isolation, resource management, and vulnerability mitigation. The elimination of all critical and high vulnerabilities represents significant progress.

However, several medium-risk areas should be addressed, particularly the use of privileged containers, root access, and shared memory mounts. These issues, while acceptable for development purposes, would require remediation in any production-like environment.

## Recommendations Summary

1. Continue regular vulnerability scanning and updates
2. Document all privileged container usage and security implications
3. Implement non-root users where possible
4. Consider implementing basic authentication for the API
5. Make sensitive values (like VNC password) configurable
6. Add security headers to HTTP responses
7. Create a maintenance schedule for regular updates
