# RESTful DOOM Microservices: Stability Improvements

## Introduction

This document outlines the key stability improvements achieved by migrating RESTful DOOM from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based approach. The primary goal of this migration is to address segmentation faults and improve overall system maintainability.

## Problem Statement

The original monolithic RESTful DOOM implementation suffered from several issues:

1. **Segmentation Faults**: The DOOM engine would occasionally crash with segmentation faults, bringing down the entire application stack including the API, VNC server, and web UI.

2. **Debugging Difficulties**: When issues occurred, it was challenging to isolate the problematic component because everything ran in a single container.

3. **Resource Contention**: All services competed for the same resources within a single container, potentially causing performance degradation.

4. **Restart Overhead**: A failure in any component required restarting the entire application stack, leading to extended downtime.

## Microservices Solution

Our microservices architecture separates the application into five distinct containers:

1. **X11 Display Container**: Manages the X11 virtual framebuffer and window manager
2. **DOOM Game Container**: Runs the DOOM engine and exposes the REST API
3. **VNC Server Container**: Provides remote access to the X11 display
4. **noVNC Container**: Enables browser-based VNC access
5. **Web UI Container**: Serves the static web interface

### Key Stability Improvements

#### 1. Isolation of Failure Domains

- **Before**: A crash in the DOOM engine would bring down the entire application stack.
- **Now**: Segmentation faults in the DOOM engine only affect the DOOM container, while other services remain operational.
- **Benefit**: Higher overall system availability and easier recovery.

#### 2. Independent Scaling and Resource Allocation

- **Before**: Resources were shared across all components in a single container.
- **Now**: Each service has dedicated resources and can be scaled independently.
- **Benefit**: More efficient resource utilization and better performance under load.

#### 3. Simplified Debugging and Maintenance

- **Before**: Logs from all components were mixed together, making issue identification difficult.
- **Now**: Each container has isolated logs, making it easier to identify the source of problems.
- **Benefit**: Faster troubleshooting and resolution of issues.

#### 4. Graceful Recovery

- **Before**: Any crash required manual intervention to restart the entire system.
- **Now**: Health checks and automatic restarts are implemented per container.
- **Benefit**: The system can recover automatically from many failure scenarios.

#### 5. Improved Development Workflow

- **Before**: Changes to any component required rebuilding and testing the entire monolith.
- **Now**: Components can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
- **Benefit**: Faster iteration and reduced risk when making changes.

## Testing Methodology

To validate the stability improvements, we've implemented a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify all features work correctly in the microservices architecture
2. **Load Testing**: Apply stress to the API to validate stability under high load
3. **Fault Injection**: Intentionally crash components to verify isolation and recovery
4. **Long-running Tests**: Verify stability over extended periods of operation

### Load Testing Tools

We've developed specialized testing tools:

- `test-microservices.sh`: Validates the health and connectivity of all microservices
- `load-test.sh`: Performs stress testing on the API with configurable concurrency and request volume

## Comparison Metrics

| Metric | Monolithic | Microservices | Improvement |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Mean Time Between Failures | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Recovery Time | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Resource Utilization | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Max Concurrent Users | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Segmentation Fault Frequency | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Future Improvements

Based on the microservices architecture, several future improvements are possible:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple instances of the DOOM engine for handling higher load
2. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Update services without downtime
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Implement detailed metrics collection and alerting
4. **Config Management**: Centralized configuration management for all services

## Conclusion

The migration to a microservices architecture represents a significant improvement in the stability and maintainability of RESTful DOOM. By isolating components, we've created a more robust system that can gracefully handle failures and scale more effectively.
