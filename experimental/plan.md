# RESTful DOOM Microservices Migration Plan

This document tracks the progress of migrating RESTful DOOM from a monolithic container architecture to a microservices-based approach. The plan is organized as a checklist to help track completed tasks and identify upcoming work.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
- [x] Identify issues with current monolithic architecture
- [x] Propose microservices architecture
- [x] Create architecture documentation
- [x] Create migration plan (this document)
- [ ] Review and finalize architecture design
- [ ] Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

### Phase 2: Environment Setup
- [x] Create base Docker images for each microservice
- [x] Set up Docker Compose configuration
- [x] Configure shared volumes for communication
- [x] Design internal Docker network
- [x] Adapt port allocation system for microservices

### Phase 3: Service Migration
- [x] **DOOM Game Container**
  - [x] Extract DOOM and API functionality from monolith
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for DOOM service
  - [x] Configure environment variables
  - [x] Prepare for testing
  
- [x] **X11 Display Container**
  - [x] Extract Xvfb and window manager setup
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for X11 service
  - [x] Configure X11 socket sharing
  - [x] Prepare for testing
  
- [x] **VNC Server Container**
  - [x] Extract VNC server configuration
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for VNC service
  - [x] Configure X11 socket connection
  - [x] Prepare for testing
  
- [x] **Web UI Container**
  - [x] Extract HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for web UI service
  - [x] Set up static file serving
  - [x] Prepare for testing
  
- [x] **noVNC Container**
  - [x] Extract noVNC configuration
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for noVNC service
  - [x] Configure VNC connection
  - [x] Prepare for testing

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- [x] Integrate all services with Docker Compose
- [x] Create testing script for validating microservices
- [x] Set up service health checks and monitoring
- [x] Develop load testing tools for stress testing
- [x] Create documentation for stability improvements
- [x] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Test communication between containers
- [ ] Verify all endpoints and interfaces are accessible
- [ ] Load testing to ensure stability
- [ ] Test fault tolerance (container restarts)
- [ ] Performance comparison with monolithic version

### Phase 5: Optimization and Finalization
- [ ] Optimize container resource allocations
- [ ] Improve logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create health check endpoints for all services
- [x] Document final architecture and deployment instructions
- [x] Create easy-to-use startup scripts

## Current Status
As of March 22, 2025:
- Completed initial architecture design
- Created documentation for the planned microservices approach
- Established migration plan and roadmap
- Completed environment setup with Docker Compose configuration
- Created Dockerfiles and entrypoint scripts for all 5 microservices
- Implemented build context structures for each service
- Fixed Dockerfile lint errors
- Created startup and testing scripts for the microservices environment
- Developed load testing tools for stability validation
- Completed service migration phase
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Documented stability improvements and comparisons
- Set up monitoring systems to track container health and performance
- Ready to execute integration testing

## Next Steps
1. Execute integration testing:
   - Run the microservices with `./experimental/scripts/start-doom.sh`
   - Validate the setup with `./experimental/scripts/test-microservices.sh`
2. Debug any issues with individual services
3. Perform stability validation:
   - Run load testing with `./experimental/scripts/load-test.sh`
   - Test different API endpoints under various concurrency levels
   - Monitor for segmentation faults during stress testing
   - Test container restarts and recovery
4. Complete documentation:
   - Gather and document performance metrics from testing
   - Create user guide for the REST API
   - Update main README with microservices information

## Issues & Challenges
- Need to ensure X11 socket sharing works properly between containers
- DOOM segmentation faults may persist if not properly isolated
- Port allocation system needs to be adapted for the microservices model
